Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

A LeetCode account

A Gmail account (or any other email provider) to send emails from.

Important for Gmail: You will need to generate an "App Password" to use for sending emails. You can find instructions here.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/leet-code-automation.git
cd leet-code-automation
2. Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file with libraries like requests and python-dotenv.)

3. Configuration
This project uses environment variables to handle your secret keys and tokens securely.

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory.

Copy the contents of .env.example into your new .env file.

Code snippet

# .env.example

# LeetCode API Credentials
LEETCODE_SESSION="YOUR_LEETCODE_SESSION_COOKIE"
CSRF_TOKEN="YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN"

# Email Configuration
SENDER_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
SENDER_PASSWORD="YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD" # Not your regular password!
RECEIVER_EMAIL="your_personal_email@example.com"
Fill in the values in your .env file.

How to get LEETCODE_SESSION and CSRF_TOKEN:
Log in to your LeetCode account in your web browser.

Open the browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Go to the Network tab.

Refresh the page or click on any problem. Find a request made to https://leetcode.com/graphql.

Click on this request and look at the Request Headers section.

Find the cookie header. Inside, you will see LEETCODE_SESSION=...; and csrftoken=...;.

Copy the corresponding values and paste them into your .env file.
